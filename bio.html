        <h1>Biography of Jheanelle Owens</h1>
        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p> Jheanelle was born in Kingston, Jamaica at UWI hospital. 
             She grew up in the countryside of St. Catherine, Jamaica where she got up
            early each morning to commute to school. Her preparatory studies began 
            at St. Hugh's Prep school, where she passed her GSAT exams and was 
        admitted to the Immaculate Conception High School. </p>

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>At Immaculate, Jheanelle joined the ICHS symphony orchestra and developed 
            her skills as a violinist and musician. She eventually went on to become
            the longest serving concert master of that group until she graduated. She 
            accomplished distinctions in all ten of her CSEC subjects, most notably placing first
            in Jamaica and third in the Caribbean for Additional Mathematics. For the CAPE
            examinations, Jheanelle obtained 4 distinctions in 12th grade and 5 distinctions in 13th grade, 
            including top placements in Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. 
        </p>

        <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
        <p>Jheanelle was accepted into Tufts University in the summer of 2017, and attended
            the institution to complete her undergraduate studies in Computer Science. While
            the CS curriculum equiped her with valuable modern day skills, the classes she took in 
            Africana studies allowed her to explore her history and gain an understanding of
            the world. She combined these two aspects of her curriculum to design
            and teach a class alongside Tony Goss in the Tufts Experimental College. She 
            taught "Techquity" to her fellow undergraduates in the spring semesters of her junior 
            and senior year. Jheanelle's anticipated graduation date is August 14, 2021.
